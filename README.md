# Event Scout

An AI-agent-powered database of speaking and networking opportunities. Two ways events get in:

1. **Manual/CSV seed** — the initial "Event List Example" spreadsheet.
2. **Agent discovery** — Claude, given a sector + search focus, searches the live web
   (`web_search` tool), researches candidate events/organizations, and normalizes what it
   finds into structured rows via a forced tool call. A second agent pass (`/api/enrich`)
   researches organizer/CFP contact info for a given event.

Stack: Next.js (App Router) on Vercel, Postgres on Supabase, Claude (Anthropic API) for
discovery/enrichment.

## Already provisioned

- Supabase project **event-scout** (org: Project I.C.O.N) — `yxejxwfhukfjrgkwhtil.supabase.co`
- Schema migration (`supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql`) already applied
- 62 events seeded from the example CSV
- `.env.local` is filled in with real Supabase keys. Only `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` needs to stay current
  (get one at [console.anthropic.com/settings/keys](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)).

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000. You'll see the seeded events, a discovery panel to run new
agent searches, filters (sector/tier/status/date range/keyword), a "Find contact" button
per row, and a CSV export link.

## Re-running the schema or reseeding

If you ever need a fresh Supabase project:

1. Create a project at supabase.com, copy `Project URL`, publishable key, and secret key into
   `.env.local` (see `.env.example` for the variable names — the app accepts either the new
   `sb_publishable_...`/`sb_secret_...` keys or legacy `anon`/`service_role` keys).
2. Run `supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor (or via `supabase db push`
   if you set up the CLI).
3. `npm run seed` — imports `scripts/seed-events.csv` (the original example list) into `events`.

## How discovery works

`POST /api/discover` with `{ "sector": "...", "query": "..." }`:

1. `researchCategory()` — Claude with the `web_search` tool searches the web for real,
   currently-scheduled opportunities matching the sector/query and returns a findings brief
   with URLs.
2. `extractEvents()` — a second Claude call, forced to call a `submit_events` tool with a
   strict JSON schema, converts the findings into rows matching the `events` table.
3. Rows are upserted into Supabase (`onConflict: event_name,event_start,source_url`).

`POST /api/enrich` with `{ "eventId": "..." }` does the same two-step pattern (research, then
forced structured extraction) to find organizer names/emails/phones for a specific event.
`/api/discover` now also auto-runs this enrichment for every event it saves, so contacts show up
without a separate manual step.

Both routes accept an optional `x-cron-secret` header (checked against `CRON_SECRET` in env)
so they can be safely triggered from an external caller (n8n, Zapier, manual curl) without a
browser session. Without `CRON_SECRET` set, they're open (fine for local dev, not for production).

## Scheduled (cron) discovery

Check "Repeat this search daily" when running a discovery from the dashboard to save it as a row
in `discovery_schedules`. A Vercel Cron job (configured in `vercel.json`, currently daily at
13:00 UTC) hits `GET /api/cron/run-scheduled`, which re-runs every *enabled* schedule end-to-end
(search → extract → save → auto-enrich contacts) and records `last_run_at`/`last_run_summary` on
each row. Toggle a schedule on/off or delete it from the "Scheduled searches" panel on the
dashboard — no redeploy needed to change which searches run.

To change the frequency, edit the `schedule` cron expression in `vercel.json` and redeploy (cron
schedules are read from that file at build time, not from the database). Note: Vercel's Hobby
plan limits cron jobs to once per day; more frequent schedules require Pro.

This route authenticates differently than the others — Vercel automatically sends
`Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>` on cron-triggered requests (its own convention, separate
from the `x-cron-secret` header used elsewhere), so `CRON_SECRET` **must** be set in Vercel for
the cron job to run at all.

## Saved lists ("smart lists")

Apply any combination of filters (sector/tier/status/date range/keyword) on the dashboard, then
click "Save as list" to bookmark that exact filter as a named, one-click shortcut — stored in
`saved_lists`. Clicking a saved list's name re-applies its filters instantly.

A saved list can also capture the results of one specific discovery run (see below) instead of a
sector/tier/etc filter — that's what "Save as list" does when you save from the default "latest
search results" view, where there's no filter to save otherwise.

**Deleting a saved list also permanently deletes every event currently matching its filter
criteria** (and their contacts, via cascade) — not just the saved shortcut. This is real, hard
data deletion with no undo, so the UI shows a confirmation naming the exact event count before
it runs. A list can never be created or deleted with zero filter criteria (that would match/wipe
every event in the database) — both the API and UI block that case.

## Default dashboard view: latest search results, not everything

Every event is tagged with a `discovery_run_id` (a UUID generated once per `runDiscovery()` call,
shared by every event that run touched). With no filters applied and no saved list open, the
dashboard shows only the events tagged with the *most recent* run — not the full accumulated
table — so a fresh search's results are immediately visible instead of buried among everything
ever found. Running a new discovery search (from the panel at the top) navigates back to this
clean default view automatically.

Applying any filter, opening a saved list, or clicking "Browse all events instead" bypasses the
"latest run" restriction and queries across every event as before. The CSV seed data and any
event whose run has since been superseded still exist and are fully reachable this way — nothing
is hidden permanently, just not shown by default.

## Deploying to Vercel

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Import it in Vercel.
3. Add the same env vars from `.env.local` (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`,
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
   and a real random `CRON_SECRET`) in Vercel's Project Settings → Environment Variables.
4. Deploy. The discovery/enrich routes have `maxDuration` set (300s/120s) since web-search
   agent calls take a while — make sure your Vercel plan supports that function duration
   (Pro plan or higher for >60s; Hobby caps at 60s, so bump `maxDuration` down or upgrade).

## What's not built yet (next steps)

- **Portfolio-organization tracking** — the `sources` table exists for treating companies whose
  business model is running recurring speaker events (Small Business Expo, BookThinkers, Top
  Talent Hollywood) as permanent watch-targets distinct from one-off conferences, but nothing
  populates it or crawls it specially yet. Scheduled discovery (above) covers *sector-level*
  recurrence; it doesn't yet have a *source-level* re-crawl of a specific known organization's site.
- **GoHighLevel export/sync** — CSV export exists (`/api/export?sector=...&tier=...&...`);
  pushing rows directly into a GHL pipeline/contact list as opportunities are found is not
  built.
- **Contact enrichment API fallback** — `/api/enrich` currently relies entirely on agent web
  search. For higher hit rates you could add Hunter.io/Apollo as a fallback when the agent
  finds an organization but no named contact.
- **Auth** — none. This is an open internal tool per the MVP scope. Add Supabase Auth if it
  needs to be multi-user or gated.
